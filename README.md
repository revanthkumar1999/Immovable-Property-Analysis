# Immovable-Property-Analysis
In this project, we are trying to build a data pipeline using Lambda architecture to handle massive quantities of data by  taking advantage of both batch and stream processing methods. Besides, we also analyze, create real-time dashboard and apply some Machine Learning models to predict the data of the Real Estate Sale 2001-2020 records.
